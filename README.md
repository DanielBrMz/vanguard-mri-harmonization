A novel Bayesian deep learning approach for cross-site MRI harmonization combining uncertainty quantification, anatomical priors, and adaptive tissue-specific regularization for T2-weighted fetal brain MRI.

**Author**: Daniel Barreras ([DanielBrMz](https://github.com/DanielBrMz))

## Key Innovations

- **Bayesian Neural Architecture**: Variational inference with principled uncertainty quantification
- **Anatomical Prior Integration**: dHCP template-guided harmonization with tissue segmentation awareness  
- **Adaptive Regularization**: Dynamic loss weighting based on tissue-specific harmonization requirements
- **Clinical Validation**: Designed for multi-center fetal neuroimaging studies with traveling subject validation
